# Teddy Picker
This is a silly little project intended to help me pick a playlist on Spotify because choice fatigue. The name is commemorative of my potentially still ongoing Arctic Monkeys phase that is proving to be an important influence on my college experience. It takes the total number of playlists in the running and then their names and lengths (in minutes!). It then calculates the average length and determines which playlist is closest to it in length. In case of playlists of same length or playlists equally close to the average it chooses the first one in the order provided on input. The aim of this was (in addition to satisfying my I-can't-just-choose-random tendencies) to practice my coding skills in java, which I was learning last year when I made this and as of now it's still intended only for use in the command prompt.

**What I hope to improve and add now:**
- graphic user interface
- time input in hours and minutes
- better handling of playlists that are equally close to the average (AKA usually same length)
- perhaps some other choosing functions like shortest/longest etc. (not sure how useful that is)
- ~~integration with the Spotify API~~ idek how that stuff works but a girl can dream :')
